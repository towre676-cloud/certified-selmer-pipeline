  -- These are propositions; we can discharge them via `simp` after you replace with real proofs.
  -- For the scaffold, we assert `True`-like goals using `simp` on the definitions.
  -- When you wire your pre-kernel proofs into Lean, replace this proof with actual lemmas.
  -- Here, since they're just definitions, the proof is by `have`/`simp` placeholders:
  have : regPositiveV := by
    -- regLoV is a concrete Float literal > 0 by construction
    -- Lean's real arithmetic for Float-literals is limited; we accept this as a placeholder.
    -- Replace with a lemma importing a checked inequality from a numeral file.
